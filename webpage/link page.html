<p> This is my dad's side of the family. This photo was taken at Thanksgiving in 2016. I don't get to see them often because they live in Ohio, so I cherish the time we spend together. </p>

<p> This is a picture of my Mommaw surrounded by most of her grandchildren. Five of my cousins were not there. My mom's side of the family lives all over the east coast, but we try to get together as much as we can. </p>
